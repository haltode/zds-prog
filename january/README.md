# January 2016

Link to the challenge : <https://zestedesavoir.com/forums/sujet/5039/janvier-2016-generation-automatique-de-texte/>

The goal of this month is to generate automatically a text in a specific language with different tasks.

## Charabia

The file charabia.py contains an algorithm to generate random strings in a language from data collected from a .csv file. The .csv file has info about frequencies in multiple languages.

My program is in Python because I learned this language a few days before the challenge, and I thought this was a great way to train myself with Python (that's why I added a graphical output, to play with matplot).
